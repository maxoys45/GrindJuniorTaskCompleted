# Grind Junior Developer task

## Setup:
- Clone the repo.
- Make sure you have node/npm installed.
- Install sass compiler `npm install -g sass`.

## Testing:
- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- To compile your SCSS into CSS, run `npm run build` in your terminal.

## Task:
- We would like you to write the JS and SCSS/CSS to show a person's details based off the ID entered into the input.
- Some of the code has been written for you but feel free to change it if you feel necessary.
- The person data is coming from [jsonplaceholder](https://www.jsonplaceholder.org/). Read the docs to see how to retrieve specific user data.
- Clean code is _key!_

## Bonus points:
- Using ES6.
- _not_ using jQuery.
